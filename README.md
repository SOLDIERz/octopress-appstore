# Octopress AppStore Plugin

An octopress plugin that displays app info from the AppStore. Please note that it only works with apps availables at the US AppStore.

## Syntax

```ruby
{% app_store app_id %}
```

## Example

Magically this:

```ruby
{% app_store 364709193 %}
```

will become this:

```html
<p id='app-widget-com-apple-ibooks'>
  <img src='http://a368.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/110/Purple/v4/a0/93/08/a0930815-e79b-fb7a-8ea0-8793ddba49f9/Icon-iPhone.png' class='app-icon' style='width:60px; height:60px; vertical-align:middle; margin: 0.1em; border: 0em' />
    <span class='app-name'>
        <a class='com-apple-ibooks' href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ibooks/id364709193?mt=8&uo=4' target='_blank'>iBooks</a>
    </span>
</p>
```

and rendered as this:
